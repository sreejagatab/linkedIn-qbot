## Technical Details

### Query Processing Flow

1. **User Interaction**: User sends a message via WhatsApp or API
2. **Message Routing**: Wati forwards the message to the bot's webhook
3. **Query Analysis**:
   - Extract profile name/ID from the query
   - Identify query category (education, experience, etc.)
   - Extract specific request details (highest degree, current job, etc.)
4. **Profile Retrieval**: Load the relevant profile data
5. **Response Generation**: Generate a natural language response based on the query and profile data
6. **Response Delivery**: Send the response back to the user via Wati or API

### NLP Implementation

The system uses a combination of techniques for natural language processing:

- **Entity Extraction**: Identify names, organizations, and other entities in the query
- **Keyword Matching**: Match query keywords to predefined categories
- **Pattern Recognition**: Use regex patterns to extract specific request details
- **Context Analysis**: Consider the overall context of the query for better understanding

### API Endpoints

The system provides the following API endpoints:

- **GET /**: API root endpoint
- **GET /profiles**: List all available profiles
- **POST /query**: Process a query about a LinkedIn profile
- **POST /add-profile**: Add a new LinkedIn profile
- **POST /wati-webhook**: Webhook endpoint for Wati integration

## Extending the System

### Adding New Profile Fields

To add support for new profile fields:

1. Update the profile data structure in `profile_scraper.py`
2. Add relevant keywords to `query_categories` in `query_processor.py`
3. Update the response generation in `_generate_response` method

Example: Adding support for "Volunteer Experience"

```python
# In query_processor.py
self.query_categories = {
    # Existing categories...
    "volunteer": ["volunteer", "volunteering", "community service", "nonprofit", "charity"]
}

# In _generate_response method
elif category == "volunteer":
    if not profile.get("volunteer_experience"):
        return f"{profile_name} has no volunteer experience information in their profile."

    vol_list = [f"{vol['role']} at {vol['organization']} ({vol['duration']})"
                for vol in profile["volunteer_experience"]]
    return f"{profile_name}'s volunteer experience: {'; '.join(vol_list)}."
```

### Enhancing NLP Capabilities

For more advanced NLP capabilities, consider:

1. Integrating a full spaCy model for better entity recognition
2. Implementing a machine learning classifier for query categorization
3. Adding support for more complex queries with multiple intents
4. Implementing conversational context to handle follow-up questions

### Adding New Response Types

To support new types of responses:

1. Create a new response generation method in `query_processor.py`
2. Add logic to handle the new response type in the main processing flow
3. Update the API documentation to reflect the new capabilities

## Performance and Scalability

### Current Performance

The system is designed to handle a moderate load of queries:

- **Response Time**: Typically under 200ms per query
- **Concurrency**: Can handle multiple simultaneous requests
- **Profile Capacity**: Efficiently manages hundreds of profiles

### Scaling Strategies

For higher loads, consider the following scaling strategies:

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Deploy multiple instances behind a load balancer
- **Caching**: Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed profiles
- **Database Integration**: Move from file-based storage to a database for larger profile collections
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Implement message queues for handling high volumes of requests

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection

- Profile data is stored as JSON files and should be properly secured
- Consider encrypting sensitive profile information
- Implement access controls for the API endpoints

### API Security

- Add authentication to the API endpoints in production
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Wati Integration Security

- Keep your Wati API key secure
- Use webhook signatures to verify incoming webhook requests
- Implement IP whitelisting for webhook endpoints

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### API Server Won't Start
- Check Python version (3.8+ required)
- Verify all dependencies are installed
- Ensure port 8000 is not in use

#### Wati Integration Fails
- Verify Wati API key is correct
- Check Wati API URL is accessible
- Ensure webhook URL is properly configured in Wati dashboard

#### Query Processing Issues
- Check profile data format is correct
- Verify query syntax is supported
- Look for specific error messages in logs

### Logging

The system uses Python's logging module for detailed logs:

- API server logs are output to the console
- Wati integration logs include webhook events and API calls
- Set log level to DEBUG for more detailed information
